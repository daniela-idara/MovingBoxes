# MovingBoxes
CSS animation

I was searching through <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665702/daniela-idara" target="new">stackoverflow</a>
to see what problems I could help solve. 

One person had two images, one static and one moving and their goal was to overlap them and still see the static image come through.

This is my research to understand the problem, css div motion and shape creation.

My resoltion can be found in motion on <a href="https://codepen.io/daniela-idara/pen/zMdbxv" target="new">CodePen.io</a>
